# it is really to hard to work it seperately
# now the thing is several people like us, who don't know much about programming
# we stay together, while also very independent
# we discuss it only when we feel desperate
# as long as there isn't anyone who is experienced in programming
# only us, we still get stucked often
# and take hours to figure out one small stuff, which is very unefficient

# this time, basically I worked alone
# when I got desperate, I asked other people
# and I also get inpiration from Yao Wang's code, and get permitted from him
# as for this part of code, I add comment
