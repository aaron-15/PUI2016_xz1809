# Assignment:

### a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

The null and alternative hypothesis are correctly formatted.

While the idea is good just a minor change in the sentence format which can be better said as the time duration of older people riding the bicycle is shorter than that of younger people riding the bicycle.

### b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet)

The appropriate features have been chosen to answer the project.
The relevant features viz.trip duration and birth year have been used to extract the needed data.

Most of the data processing is done correctly but I see that you have divided bins into age groups of 20 which cannot be used to divide the datasets into that stated in the hypothesis which is above age 45 and below age 45. 


### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

Since the hypothesis is used to find the difference in data in two categories (greater than 45 years of age and below 45 years of age) I would use the ANOVA test.
