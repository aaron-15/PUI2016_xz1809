### Markdown file for assignment 1 of the Homework 4.

### Markdown file to be made from assignment 2 of the Homework 4.

### Xinge Zhong(xz1809) to create and complete the evaluation of Adrian K Dahlin (akd361),adriandahlin.

Forked, Cloned and Written .md file.

### Assignment:

### a. Verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

Idea: Does age affect the ride duration for Citi Bike trips taken in January, 2016?

Alternative hypothesis: There is a negative correlation between age of riders and trip duration, with a .05 confidence level.

Null hypothesis: Age and trip duration are inversely related at less than a .05 confidence interval OR there is no apparent relationship OR there is a positive relationship.

#The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis don't directly deriviated from the orginal idea. The original idea is more like to solve the question of "Yes and No", instead of "Positive effect or Negtive effect".


### b. Verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet)

#The data has the appropriate variables and has been successfully processed to remove all but the trip duration, birth year and gender year so that other data sets can be created from these factors. 

#But I think the scatter and histogram you made is bit confused to me. Take the histogram for an example, the "Age" and the "Duration", is independent variable and dependent varible, I don't think they can be put in the same axis in histogram. 

### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. 

#You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

#First, I think you need to reconsider your idea and hypothesis. Your precious hypothesis, which already writes on "positive" or "negative", has already presumed that the correlation exists. Maybe you can use statistical test to prove the correlation's existence first.

#If the data taken was categorical,then a T-TEST would be appropriate for hypothesis, because the independent variable is "Yes or No" question, and there is only one dependent variable.


#If you would like to classify the ages into age groups, while the duration variable is continuous, I would suggest that you can use ANOVA test. Since that there are now several groups to classify, so that we can test the significance of group differences between two or more groups.
